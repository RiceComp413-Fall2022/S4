## Pitch:

We want to create a distributed object storage system like S3 that focuses on the distributed aspects like reliability and scalability. Instead of creating an entire web front-end, we will be using REST API calls (GET and PUT) to upload and download files (we may or may not restrict the file types if there are certain difficulties). We will use 4 free AWS EC2 instances (1 free instance per team member) for distributed file storage and 1 web server that acts as a master. Users will communicate with the web server, and the server appropriately distributes the file(s) to the EC2 instances. Stretch goals include load balancing, fault tolerance, and scalability (make sure file download/upload doesnâ€™t slow down with more instances, use fewer/more servers with changing demand).

## Run on AWS:
### Setup:
1. Set up AWS credentials and region: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html (region should be us-east-1 by default). This can also be done with `aws configure` if the AWS CLI is set up.
2. Copy S4.pem into the top-level directory, at the same level as startup.py.
### Start nodes:
1. Run the startup script: `python3 startup.py <# nodes>` where the number of nodes is > 1. This will start one main node and the rest will be worker nodes.
2. Once the script is finished, it will output the URL for the load balancer. To interact with the endpoints via Swagger, visit that URL.
### Scale Up:
1. After running the startup script, run the scale_up script: `python3 scale_up.py`. This will double the number of current nodes, using information on the main node and current worker nodes stored in the files scale_info.txt and nodes.txt
2. After the script is complete, it will output the URLs of the new worker nodes.
### Scale Down:
1. After running the startup script, run the scale_down script: `python3 scale_down.py`. This will halve the number of currently running workers, if there are more than 3 workers running. Workers no longer needed will be removed from the load balancer and terminated.
2. After the script is complete, it will output the URL of the worker nodes that were terminated.
### Cleanup:
1. After running the startup script and any of the other scripts, clean up the resources with `python3 cleanup.py`. This will delete the load balancer, target group, security group, and terminate all instances.

## First Time Setup:

1. Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.8.9:
   `python3 -m venv ./venv`
2. Activate virtual environment:
   `source ./venv/bin/activate`
3. Install requirements:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Setup environment variables:
   add the following line to the end of your venv/bin/activate script: <br>
   `export FILE_PATH=your_file_path_here`
   For example:
   `export FILE_PATH=/Users/ericy/Desktop`. Remember to add the '/' in front of the path, or else it will not work.

## Run the Server:

1. Run the server: `cd src && flask run`
2. To use see the Swagger documentation, visit the URL to the newly spun-up server (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Run Tests:

1. To run the unit tests, type `pytest` **in the test directory**.

## Endpoints
1. **generateKey:** Currently just generates a random key of length 16. Will remove later.
2. **GetObject:** Currently just gets a file from the specified local output path. This is the 
'export FILE_PATH' variable you have set. In the request parameters, you need to put a key called "Key" (with the uppercase K), and a "Value" as the name of your file (we will change this)
3. **PutObject:** Currently just puts a file as specified in the request body to the location specified in your 'export FILE_PATH' variable. The request parameters needs a key and a value. The value will be used later on to match files, but now it does nothing. The request body must be a file, and the value must be the actual file contents. You can do this easily in postman. Or you can do it in the swagger UI on 127.0.0.1:5000.
4. **ListObjects:** Currently just lists all of the objects in same directory that the FILE_PATH path lies. Will be modified to list just the objects in the DB?
